Virtual voice assistance
The rise of automation, along with increased computational power, 
novel application of statistical algorithms, and improved accessibility to data, 
have resulted in the birth of the personal digital assistant market, popularly 
represented by Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Google’s Google Assistant, and Amazon’s Alexa.
While each assistant may specialize in slightly different tasks, they all seek to 
make the user’s life easier through verbal interactions so you don’t have to search 
out a keyboard to find answers to questions like “What’s the weather today?” or “Where is Switzerland?”.
Despite the inherent “cool” factor that comes with using a digital assistant, you may find that the 
aforementioned digital assistants don’t cater to your specific needs. Fortunately, it’s relatively 
easy to build our own.
